This is a modified version of the code associated with the paper [*Punctuation Restoration using Transformer Models for High-and Low-Resource Languages*](http://noisy-text.github.io/2020/pdf/2020.d200-1.18.pdf) accepted at the EMNLP workshop [W-NUT 2020](http://noisy-text.github.io/2020/).
See README.original.md for details about the original code. Original code can be accessed from GitHub: https://github.com/xashru/punctuation-restoration.git

This code was changed to support Romanian language, Romanian BERT and punctuation from the MARCELL corpus. It was further enhanced with a JSON REST API server
allowing trained models to be served online.
